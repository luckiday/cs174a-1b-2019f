                                           // Wikipedia has good defintions for these concepts.  Subclasses of class Shader each store 
                                           // and manage a complete GPU program.  This particular one is a big "master shader" meant to 
                                           // handle all sorts of lighting situations in a configurable way. 
                                           // Phong Shading is the act of determining brightness of pixels via vector math.  It compares
                                           // the normal vector at that pixel to the vectors toward the camera and light sources.
          // *** How Shaders Work:
                                           // The "vertex_glsl_code" string below is code that is sent to the graphics card at runtime, 
                                           // where on each run it gets compiled and linked there.  Thereafter, all of your calls to draw 
                                           // shapes will launch the vertex shader program once per vertex in the shape (three times per 
                                           // triangle), sending results on to the next phase.  The purpose of this vertex shader program 
                                           // is to calculate the final resting place of vertices in screen coordinates; each vertex 
                                           // starts out in local object coordinates and then undergoes a matrix transform to get there.
                                           //
                                           // Likewise, the "fragment_glsl_code" string is used as the Fragment Shader program, which gets 
                                           // sent to the graphics card at runtime.  The fragment shader runs once all the vertices in a 
                                           // triangle / element finish their vertex shader programs, and thus have finished finding out 
                                           // where they land on the screen.  The fragment shader fills in (shades) every pixel (fragment) 
                                           // overlapping where the triangle landed.  It retrieves different values (such as vectors) that 
                                           // are stored at three extreme points of the triangle, and then interpolates the values weighted 
                                           // by the pixel's proximity to each extreme point, using them in formulas to determine color.
                                           // The fragment colors may or may not become final pixel colors; there could already be other 
                                           // triangles' fragments occupying the same pixels.  The Z-Buffer test is applied to see if the

Google "es6" instead of "JavaScript" when learning to avoid missing newer capabilities.  Generally, you'll want to get comfortable with imperative, object oriented, and functional programming styles to use this library.   
    </p><p>This first article is meant to show how best to organize a 3D graphics program in JavaScript using WebGL -- a \"hello world\" example, or more accurately, \"hello triangle\". A lot of \"boilerplate\" code is required just to get a single 3D triangle to draw on a web canvas, and it's not at all obvious how to organize that code so that you can be flexible later, when you'll probably want to dynamically switch out pieces of your program whenever you want - whether they be other shader programs, vertex arrays (shapes), textures (images), or entire scenes. You might even want those things to happen whenever the user of your program presses a button.    
    </p><p>This \"hello triangle\" example is organized to do all that while keeping its source code tiny. A ~500 line library file called tiny-graphics.js sets up all the flexibility mentioned above, and it's shared by all pages on this encyclopedia.  That file can always be accessed <a href=/tiny-graphics.js>here</a>.  A file called dependencies.js contains all the code required by the particular article you're viewing on the encyclopedia of code. Every article you navigate to on the encyclopedia will provide you with a minimal copy of dependencies.js, containing only the code that your current article needs.    
    </p><p>If you have never written a graphics program before, you'll need to know what a transformation matrix is in 3D graphics. Check out <a href=https://piazza.com/class_profile/get_resource/j855t03rsfv1cn/j9k7wl8ijmks0 target='_blank'>this other .pdf document</a> explaining those, including the three special matrices (rotation, translation, and scale) that you'll see over and over in graphics programs like this one. Finally, scroll down to the source code at the bottom to see how these functions are used to generate special matrices that draw the shapes in the right places in the 3D world.    
    </p><p>The scene shown here demonstrates a lot of concepts at once using very little code.  These include drawing your first triangle, storing trivial shapes, storing lights and materials and shader programs, flat vs. smooth shading, and matrix transformations.   You can see all the parts of the scene being drawn by the code written in the "display" function; these parts are all independent from one another, so feel free delete whichever sections you want from there and the other shapes will remain.  Save your changes to produce your own page.
